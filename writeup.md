# Follow Me Write-up

## Rubics
#### 1. Provide a write-up / README document
You are reading it!

#### 2. The write-up conveys the an understanding of the network architecture.
In this project, I implemented SegNet. The goal is to identify target, pedestrians and others in pixelwise manner. This is achieved by building an series of encoder blocks. An encoder block is composed separable convolution layer. The advantage of separable convolution layers is less parameters to train. As for decoder block,
